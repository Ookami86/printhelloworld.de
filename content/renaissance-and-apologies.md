I do apologize for not blogging more the last year or so. This post,
half apology and half promise, marks my comeback to blogging. Read on if
you are interested in what I have been up to and what I plan for the
future.<!--more-->h2. From grand aspirations to sudden realizations

My Blog was online for a few years, before I decided to take the site
down for a redesign. Why did I do such a thing, you might ask? Well, the
answer is twofold... I wanted a big relaunch of my site to accompany my
entrance into the world of the (somewhat) professional App developer,
selling Apps on the App Stores of this planet.

In unrelated matters, I really wanted to do some project with Django, a
Python Web Framework I recently learned to love. So I tried to migrate
my Blog to a Django application for quite a few months.

So why did I finally give up and move the Blog back to Wordpress? First
of all, I found that I couldn't quite settle on a Design. I tried
several times to come up with a design for the site, but and none of
them really met the level of quality I expected and I just kept fiddling
with it until I couldn't see it any more (being a Techie and no
Designer, I am not ashamed to admit defeat on this matter).

The other thing I realized is that I have just too much going on in my
life right now. I could either keep attempting to half-heartedly put
something great together, or focus my energies on a fraction of
activities and accomplish those really well.

Long story short: I will discontinue most of the software Projects I
pursued and focus on a fraction I can maintain.
