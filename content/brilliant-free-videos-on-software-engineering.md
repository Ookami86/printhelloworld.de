I love to watch talks on software engineering. To me, they're a great
source of inspiration and knowledge, I can just cram somewhere into a
quiet evening on the couch.

I found it quite a discovery that so many videos of talks I deem
absolutely brilliant are available on the web - for free! And now I
would like to share with you some of these video gems I discovered so
far - so without further ado, here's a list of my favorite videos on
software engineering, grouped by topic<!--more-->:

Agile Software Engineering
--------------------------

 [  
Agile/XP Overview (DDL)  
][]
:   Robert Martin shines a spotlight on the flaws of the "traditional"
    phase-oriented software development methods, before introducing a
    brief history and the key advantages of Agile methods and how they
    address the flaws of phase-oriented software development.

 [  
Real Software Engineering][]
:   This talk by Glenn Vanderburg highlights the misconceptions in
    software engineering that led to the document-centric,
    phase-oriented approach to software engineering that is predominant
    these days. It does so by pointing out the differences between what
    Vanderburg calls "a caricature of an engineering discipline" that is
    software engineering and "real" engineering.

Software Architecture
---------------------

 [  
Architecture: The lost years  
][]
:   Brilliant keynote delivered by Robert Martin. He presents his
    preferred architecture for MVC-ish web apps, based on Ivar
    Jacobson's book "Object-Oriented Software Engineering - A Use Case
    Driven Approach". Takeway: Good architecture is about introducing
    abstraction at the right place, to ensure flexibility.

Testing and Test-Driven Development
-----------------------------------

 [  
The Deep Synergy Between Testability and Good Design  
][]
:   Great talk by Michael Feathers, about the way testability issues
    point out design flaws in software.

Emergent/Evolutionary Design
----------------------------

 [  
Evolutionary Design Illustrated (DDL)  
][]
:   This talk by James Shore introduces the idea of evolutionary design,
    guided by tests and refactoring. The evolution of a real software
    system is then visualized by class diagrams of the personal finance
    tracking software, Shore develops in his [Let's Play TDD][]
    screencast.

 [  
The Transformation Priority Premise (DDL)  
][]
:   Another talk by Robert Martin, introducing the notion of tests
    driving algorithm design, followed by an interesting theory, where
    the order of transformations applied to production code during TDD
    may have an effect on the quality of the resulting algorithms.

Software Craftsmanship
----------------------

 [  
Filling the Professionallism Gap  
][]
:   In this talk Robert Martin touches upon the alleged lack of
    professionalism he sees amongst software developers and how the
    software craftsmanship movement may be a first step towards a more
    mature software industry.

 [  
Craftsmanship/Deliberate Practice (DDL)  
][]
:   This talk by Corey Haines touches on a lot of topics: software
    craftsmanship and the role of practice, TDD, emergent design and
    professionalism in it.

Domain-Driven Design
--------------------

 [  
DDD: Putting the model to work  
][]
:   In this talk Eric Evans explains the fundamentals of domain-driven
    design and how domain modeling may improve the design of software
    applications with complex problem domains.

I hope these videos will inspire you as much as they did me. Also feel
free to add your own discoveries to this page as a comment :-)
