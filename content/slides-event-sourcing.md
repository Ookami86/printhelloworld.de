I recently had the opportunity to present a talk on [Event Sourcing](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) at Java User Group in Frankfurt. 

My slide deck is [available on Github](https://github.com/Ookami86/event-sourcing-in-practice), and I would very much appreciate your feedback and/or pull requests.

In case your are interested, I will be giving this talk again in Feburary next year together with Benjamin Reitzammer, at the [Entwicklertag Frankfurt](http://www.entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2014/session/event-sourcing-der-praxis)
