I recently prepared a presentation entitled "Painless Testing - Writing testable
code" for work and I would like to share it with you. There is a [Python
Version][python-slides] of and a [Java Version][java-slides] the slides available.

These slides will require an HTML5 capable browser such as any recent
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari version. Press the right/left
keys on your keyboard or click somewhere near the right or left edge of
your browser window to switch slides.

The talk is based on [this amazing guide][] by Miško Hevery (Google) and
others.

**Update:** This is the 2nd complete revision of my talk, published on
March 7th 2012, for my talk at the Java User Group Göttingen.
