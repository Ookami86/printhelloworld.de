Projects I ran into some trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of Xcode 4.3, the Jenkins Xcode Plugin 1.3.1 and the
Jenkins CI Version 1.458 does not seem to play well together. Whenever I
tried to build an Xcode project, the build failed with the following
message:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements, please run xcodebuild standalone from within a Terminal window to review and agree to the Xcode license agreements. Build step 'XCode' marked build as failure Finished: FAILURE&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to the terminal and entered the exact same build command
from the Jenkins logs, the project built just fine. Weird. I googled for
the error message, but did not find anything on the web.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I discovered the problem: The installer package I got from
http://jenkins-ci.org installed a LaunchDeamon configuration, running
Jenkins as the "daemon" user. This is a good thing for security - but
unfortunately it doesn't work well with the latest Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to run the following command:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo xcodebuild -license&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will display the Xcode license agreement, so you can accept it for
all users on your Mac, including the daemon user. Problem solved. Enjoy
your Jenkins Server!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
